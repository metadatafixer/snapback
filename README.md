# Snapback

Free Chrome extension for backing up your Google Photos library to your computer.

No Google Takeout, no waiting for ZIP files, no hassle.

## Install

[Get Snapback on Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/snapback/cgfadfbkedicjkjgiklhjplnnfhnjapf)

## How it works

1. Open Snapback from the side panel on photos.google.com
2. Pick a folder on your computer
3. Click Start Backup

Snapback scans your library and downloads every photo and video in original quality, organized into folders by year and month.

## Features

- Original quality downloads (photos and videos)
- Automatic folder organization (YYYY/MM)
- Pause and resume backups at any time
- Session history — pick up where you left off
- Handles Live Photos and motion photos
- Preserves all metadata (dates, GPS, descriptions, favorites) as JSON sidecar files
- Optionally delete backed-up photos from Google Photos to free storage

## Metadata

Downloaded files may have incorrect dates or missing GPS data. All metadata is saved alongside your photos in .json sidecar files, compatible with Google Takeout format. Use [Metadata Fixer](https://metadatafixer.com) to embed dates, locations, and descriptions back into your files.

## Privacy

No account required. No data leaves your browser — everything is saved directly to your computer.
